These are some of my go-tos for a sweet protein snack to have when my daughter's snacking when on parental leave. These are great with a cup of coffee or just on their own.

## Instructions

- Melt the dark chocolate. I'm using a double boiler for this, but you can also use the microwave.
- Once the chocolate is melted, transfer to a bowl and mix in the casein protein powder. Mix well until smooth.
- Add the chunky peanut butter and mix until well combined.
- On a baking sheet, lay out the wafers in a single layer and spread a thick layer of the chocolate mixture on top.
- Add another layer of wafers on top and spread the remaining chocolate mixture on top.
- Sprinkle the flaky salt on top (optional but highly recommended).
- Freeze for 45-60 minutes until solid, or leave in the fridge a couple of hours.
- Cut into 10 pieces with a sharp knife.
