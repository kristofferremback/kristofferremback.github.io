This recipe makes 2 servings of chocolate protein ice cream. This is my personal favorite ice cream recipe, it has a stupid rich chocolate flavor.

## Instructions

- Add half the milk to the Ninja CREAMi bowl and then add the Xanthan gum. After that, add the rest of the milk, the sweeteners, cacao powder, and the salt. Mix well until the xanthan gum is dissolved.
- Add the protein powder and mix again until _stupid thick_.
- Add the yogurt and mix it in. This should fill up the bowl up to the max line.
- Put in the freezer overnight without a lid and make sure it's not tilted.
- Take it out 15 minutes before blending
- Blend using the Light Ice Cream setting once and take it out to check if it needs a Respin.

### Mix-ins

The chocolate base is fantastic with these combinations:

#### Frozen raspberries and dark chocolate

      amount: 10,
      unit: 'g',

#### Mini marshmallows and dark chocolate

      amount: 20,
      unit: 'g',
    },
    {
      ref: "dark-chocolate-chips",
      name: "Dark chocolate",
      amount: 10,
      unit: 'g',
    },
    {

      name: "Bodylab Chocolate Sauce",
      amount: 15,
      unit: 'g',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Notes

Changing/fixing the texture:
- If it's a little crumbly, try pressing it down with a spoon and Respin. Otherwise try the next suggestion.
- If it looks like snow after the first spin, add a splash of milk (like a tablespoon) and use the Respin setting. This should fix it.
- If you want McFlurry-style ice cream, add two tablespoons of milk and respin even if it looks like normal ice cream after the first spin. This gives that melty, soft-serve texture that a good McFlurry should have.
