This recipe makes 2 servings of protein vanilla ice cream. Or honestly, have the entire batch it's not unreasonable.

## Instructions

- Add half the milk to the Ninja CREAMi bowl and then add the Xanthan gum. After that, add the rest of the milk, the sweeteners, and the the salt. Mix well until the xanthan gum is dissolved.
- Add the protein powder and mix again until _stupid thick_.
- Add the yogurt and mix it in. This should fill up the bowl up to the max line.
- Put in the freezer overnight without a lid and make sure it's not tilted.
- Take it out 15 minutes before blending
- Blend using the Light Ice Cream setting once and take it out to check if it needs a Respin.

### Mix-ins

This recipe works without mix-ins, but just plain I don't find it fantastic. **With mix-ins it's great!**. Here are some suggested combinations:

#### Frozen blueberries

    {
      ref: "frozen-blueberries",
      name: 'Frozen blueberries',
      amount: 60,
      unit: 'g',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Frozen passion fruit and white chocolate

<MacrosTable
  ingredients={[
    {
      ref: "frozen-passion-fruit",
      name: 'Frozen passion fruit',
      amount: 50,
      unit: 'g',
    },
    {
      ref: "white-chocolate",
      name: "Chopped up white chocolate",
      amount: 20,
      unit: 'g',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Double Daim and Body Labs Salted Caramel Sauce

<MacrosTable
  ingredients={[
    {
      ref: "daim",
      name: 'Double Daim',
      amount: 56,
      unit: 'g',
    },
    {
      ref: "body-labs-salted-caramel-sauce",
      name: "Body Labs Salted Caramel Sauce",
      amount: 15,
      unit: 'g',
    },
  ]}
/>

I've found frozen berries works better than fresh ones, but I won't stop you from using fresh ones.

## Notes

Changing/fixing the texture:
- If it's a little crumbly, try pressing it down with a spoon and Respin. Otherwise try the next suggestion.
- If it looks like snow after the first spin, add a splash of milk (like a tablespoon) and use the Respin setting. This should fix it.
- If you want McFlurry-style ice cream, add two tablespoons of milk and respin even if it looks like normal ice cream after the first spin. This gives that melty, soft-serve texture that a good McFlurry should have.
