This recipe makes 3 large pancakes or 6 smaller once. These days I typically do the smaller ones as they cook a little bit better.

I'm using a mortar and pestle to grind the chia seeds, it works really well and takes like ten seconds. When I tried using our food processor, it just spun the chia seeds around in a cool looking vortex but didn't actually grind them. Visually cool, but not useful in my case. Maybe yours is better?

## Instructions:

- Grind the chia seeds enough to _open up_. They don't have to be a fine powder, just enough to break them up.
- In a bowl, add all the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix them together.
- Mix in the milk, egg, and quark and mix until there are no dry spots left. **Try not to overmix**.
- Add the dark chocolate chips and mix gently until they are distributed evenly.
- Let the batter sit for about 10 minutes or until your patience runs out. I typically start a pot of coffee and start making my daughters banana pancakes right around here.
