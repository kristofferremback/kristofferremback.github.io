This is the first post. More to come.

## What this site is

A place for writing about software, cooking, and whatever else comes to mind.

## Code example

Here's some TypeScript to verify syntax highlighting works:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('world'));
```

That's it for now.
